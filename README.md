Daily Planner

**Decription**
This is a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day. This alllows employees with a busy schedule to add important events to a daily planner so that they can manage their time effectively.

- The current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
- Timeblocks for standard business hours are presented
- Each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
- After clicking into a timeblock an event can be entered and saved when the adjacent save button is clicked.
- That event is saved in local storage and is avilable after refreshing the page.
